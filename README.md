# project-6
This project try to solve a problem about E-bike market.

As initial information, I have started with a dataset with info about the demands expected in this field  made in 2020, and a new revision of the dataset 2 years after where the demands expected have decreased around 50%.
The target of this project is to find possible answer to this situation, and find potential actions to increase this demandas as much as possible.

The data that I will use come from:
  - Small dataset with demandas variation provided by a person who works in this sector.
  - A survey made to random potential customers. (sample with size at least 40 people) --> 80 answers gathered in the end.
  - Demographic dataset. This dataset will help to take outputs in the context of the whole spanish population.

The df obteined from the survey could be divided in 2 dfs. 
  1. Descriptive data from current market situation. --> descriptive_df
  2. Data useful for potential actions to increase sells. --> predictive_df
Of course, some of the columns will be presented in both df.
